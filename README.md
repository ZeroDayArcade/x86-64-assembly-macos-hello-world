### Follow along the full tutorial: <a href="https://zerodayarcade.com/tutorials/hello-world-assembly-macos">Learn x86-64 Assembly for macOS: Hello World</a>

The full tutorial includes core concepts in assembly and a line-by-line code explanation. You'll need to understand what the code means in order to write your own assembly code or to use your knowledge for <a href="https://zerodayarcade.com/tutorials/solving-beginner-crackmes-part-1">reverse engineering</a>. To simply assemble and run the program, open Terminal and follow the steps below:
<br/><br/>


## Get the code
Clone this project:
```
git clone https://github.com/ZeroDayArcade/x86-64-assembly-macos-hello-world.git
```
cd into the project directory:
```
cd x86-64-assembly-macos-hello-world
```

## Assemble the program
Assemble the code into an object (.o) file:
```
as hello_assembly.s -o hello_assembly.o
```
Create a UNIX executable with the object file using gcc:
```
gcc -o hello_assembly hello_assembly.o -nostdlib -static
```

## Run the program
```
./hello_assembly
```
You should now see "Hello World" printed in the Terminal.
